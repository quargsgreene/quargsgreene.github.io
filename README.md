Non-Sequitur - An interactive collection of sound waves
===================================

Non-Sequitur is an collection of songs which provides the listener an alternative multimedia experience to listening compared to streaming services such as Spotify. Here, you will find a landing page for interactive installations, completely out of context quotes, and generative visuals sprinkled throughout the song collection. I am responsible for all of the performance involving vocals, viola, mandolin, and synthesizers. I also wrote every single note and lyric and am the programmer behind all of the code. For alternate versions of certain installations accompanied by less explanation, work in other genres, some researcch, along with links to other social media platforms and updates regarding traditional music releases, you may visit my artist website at [https://pixelatedflesh.com/](https://pixelatedflesh.com/). Enjoy!

Eustachian Food Slide 
---------------------
* [Listen to the whole song here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5btburvpop4sp0n/Eustachian%20Food%20Slide%202%2048k%2010192022.mp3?dl=0)

  Ever wonder what music could accompany the fantastical situation of food sliding unscathed down one's Eustachian tubes?
  Well, now you know.

* [Looping Shape Cereal](https://quargsgreene.github.io/looping-shape-cereal/)

  Inspired by viewing numerous [stim boards](https://www.yourdictionary.com/stim-board) on Tumblr, Looping Shape Cereal utilizes two drum samples from the   aforementioned song, isolating them for the user's clicking, as well as providing a selection of accompanying looping visuals.
  Watch purple squares bounce over and over or see an assortment of polygons change color until the cows come home, and more. One can also type any         favorite phrases at their own leisure in the provided form without having to worry about submission. One can also generate more squiggles and ellipses     on the page via making noise into one's microphone. With the use of a screen reader, the user additionally has access to hidden audio. You can also       expand and contract the browser window to watch the panels go wild. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/quargsgreene/looping-shape-cereal).
  
* [Mustard Aquarium](https://quargsgreene.github.io/mustard-aquarium/)

  When the user presses the 'Eustachian Food Slide' button, the aforementioned song will be streamed at a random speed and direction between between        0 (exclusive) and 2 (inclusive) times the original speed. While the audio streams, the amplitude data from the audio file will appear
  in a visualizer on the screen which is shared between a collection of yellow rectangles and circles in an assortment of colors.
  If you use a screen reader, you can access a secret message, as well as an alert window and burst of pink noise. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/quargsgreene/mustard-aquarium).

  on the matter.

* [Rotating Flesh Spirals](https://quargsgreene.github.io/rotating-flesh-spirals/)

  Like [Looping Shape Cereal](https://github.com/quargsgreene/looping-shape-cereal), I once more became inspired by the idea of stim boards and created a   three-dimensional version. With just one click of the 'Wee!' button, the user can watch elbow and hand flesh-textured and cone meshes in the shape of fusilli pasta rotate and move around the scene while also having the capability to click in order to rotate the scene such that one has the choice of multiple different groupings of instruments to emphasize within the corresponding song during streaming.

  and exist among a variety of nondescript meshes. In the distance lies a spinning cube streaming the aforementioned song, which the user has the
  ability to navigate towards in order to customize the listening experience. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/quargsgreene/equivocal-pixel-chimney/tree/main).
