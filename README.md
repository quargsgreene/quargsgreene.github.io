For alternate versions of certain installations accompanied by less explanation, along with links to other social media platforms and updates regarding traditional music releases, you may visit my artist website at [https://pixelatedflesh.com/](https://pixelatedflesh.com/).

Eustachian Food Slide 
---------------------
* [Listen to the whole song here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5btburvpop4sp0n/Eustachian%20Food%20Slide%202%2048k%2010192022.mp3?dl=0)

  Ever wonder what music could accompany the fantastical situation of food sliding unscathed down one's Eustachian tubes?
  Well, now you know.

* [Looping Shape Cereal](https://quargsgreene.github.io/Looping-Shape-Cereal/)

  Inspired by viewing numerous [stim boards](https://www.yourdictionary.com/stim-board) on Tumblr, Looping Shape Cereal utilizes two drum samples from the   aforementioned song, isolating them for the user's clicking, as well as providing a selection of accompanying looping visuals.
  Watch purple squares bounce over and over or see an assortment of polygons change color until the cows come home, and more. One can also type any           favorite phrases at their own leisure in the provided form without having to worry about submission. With the use of a screen reader, the user
  additionally has access to hidden audio. You can also expand and contract the browser window to watch the panels go wild. 
  You can view the code [here](https://github.com/quargsgreene/Looping-Shape-Cereal).
  
* [Mustard Aquarium](https://quargsgreene.github.io/Mustard-Aquarium/)

  When the user presses the 'Eustachian Food Slide' button, the aforementioned song will be streamed at a random speed and direction between between        0 (exclusive) and 2 (inclusive) times the original speed. While the audio streams, the amplitude data from the audio file will appear
  in a visualizer on the screen which is shared between a collection of yellow rectangles and circles in an assortment of colors.
  If you use a screen reader, you can access a secret message, as well as an alert window and burst of pink noise.

  I began writing this piece curious about the ways I could exploit the built-in MIDI capabilities of the notation software, Sibelius. This collection
  of organized sound is the result of that exploration.
