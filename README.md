Non-Sequitur - An Interactive Album
===================================

Non-Sequitur is an album which provides the listener an alternative experience to listening compared to streaming services such as Spotify. 
Here, you will find a landing page for interactive installations which leverage the data of each song, whether the lyrics, amplitude, or 
frequency data, along with descriptions of the motivation and intent behind each one. For alternate, more layperson-oriented versions 
accompanied by less explanation, along with links to other social media platforms and updates regarding traditional music releases, 
you may visit my artist website at [https://pixelatedflesh.com/](https://pixelatedflesh.com/).
